# DESwiz

DESwiz is a discrete event system tool for working with finite state automata
and other systems. It has been designed as proof-of-concept for academic works
in theoretical computer science developed at Inria (Rennes, France) and Mount
Allison University (Sackville, Canada).

## Current Features

- Composing two automata with union and product operations

## Upcoming Features

- Checking to make sure that every time a user gives an automaton, it is
formatted appropriately

## Input Specification

Input for the program must be specified correctly in a text file, which is then passed into the program. For information on how to create the text file, see https://github.com/gzinck/des/wiki/Input-Specification
